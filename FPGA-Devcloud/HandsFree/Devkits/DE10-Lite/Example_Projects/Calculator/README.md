# Calculator

This is a lab to test your knowledge in assembling a small FPGA calculator project on the DE10- Lite remote development kit. The circuit adds the values of two counters (0-98) that are enabled with push button (KEY) switches. The two addends and the sum are displayed on the seven segment displays. Since the sum can overflow to a 3rd hundreds place digit and there are only 6 seven segment displays, the hundreds position should be represented by lighting up all 10 LEDs simultaneously.
