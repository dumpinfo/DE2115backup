# BlankProject

This Example Project is an empty template for the Remote Console board. Use this .qar file to try any other projects outside of those given in the examples. This project is also the starting point for the [Intro to Quartus](https://github.com/intel/FPGA-Devcloud/blob/master/main/HandsFree/Devkits/DE10-Lite/Example_Projects/Intro_to_Quartus/Intro_to_Quartus_Remote_Lab.pdf) project. Like the rest of the Remote Console Example Projects, don't forget to instantiate your User Design at the Top level!
