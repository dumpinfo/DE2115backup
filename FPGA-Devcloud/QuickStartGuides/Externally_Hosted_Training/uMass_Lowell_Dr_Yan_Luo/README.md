# University of Massachusetts Lowell: Intel FPGA Devcloud Training

 

## 1       Introduction

We are pleased to be partnering with Dr Yan Luo at uMass Lowell for FPGA devcloud based Heterogeneous Computing coursework. This course introduces heterogeneous computing architecture and the design and optimization of applications that best utilize the resources on such platforms. The course topics include heterogeneous computer architecture, offloading architecture/API, operating systems for heterogeneous resources, GPU/FPGA acceleration, OpenCL programming framework, performance optimization, and software development. Labs are included to practice design methodology and tools.
