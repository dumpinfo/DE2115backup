## Introduction

### Summary

Welcome to the FPGA DevCloud. This is a QuickStart guide that will demonstrate a basic project setup and execution in Quartus using the Intel hosted cloud service known as the DevCloud.

At the end of this guide, the user will be able to run and simulate a project in the Quartus Prime Software both **locally** to a development board connected to the user’s PC, and **remotely** through the SSH connection to the DevCloud servers. ModelSim, University Waveform, and the In-System Memory Content editor tool will be used to demonstrate a successful remote access to the DevCloud servers and provide insight into the Quartus FPGA development flows. Additionally, usage of the GUI and command line flows will be demonstrated.

The programming image will be downloaded to a development kit connected to the devcloud, and optionally to a local DE10-Lite board if you have one in your possession.

### Assumptions

This user guide assumes the following:

* Basic FPGA knowledge
* Basic understanding of an editor (i.e. vi, emacs)
* Intel Devcloud registration and SSH key set up
* MobaXterm installed and set up
* X2Go Client application installed



## Lab 1: Launching Quartus Prime Software

This is a short lab that completes the basic project setup using both the Quartus Prime GUI and Tcl Console. At the end of this lab, you will be able to start a new project in the DevCloud using Quartus Prime Software.

#### 1.0: Editing and Sourcing Quartus Prime Lite/Pro Software

- [ ] Properly connect to the DevCloud server and have the X2Go windowing system open. Please refer to the *[Public Devcloud Access Instructions](https://github.com/intel/FPGA-Devcloud/tree/master/main/Devcloud_Access_Instructions#devcloud-access-instructions)* that were sent to you when you first registered for an account in order to know how to connect to the DevCloud.
- [ ] Open a terminal window in the X2Go client by right-clicking on the desktop and selecting “Open Terminal Here”
- [ ] In the terminal, edit the quartus_setup.sh file to ensure that Quartus Lite edition is running.

*Note: Launch* ***Quartus Prime Lite*** *if the board you are connecting to contains a MAX/Cyclone class device. Otherwise, launch* ***Quartus Prime Pro*** *if the board is a Arria/Stratix.*

###### Figure 1: Correct settings for the quartus_setup.sh file

- [ ] After editing the quartus_setup.sh file, source the quartus_setup.sh file and run Quartus. Enter the following in the terminal by sequence:

```bash
source ~/quartus_setup.sh
quartus &
```

- [ ] Ensure that the main window of the Quartus environment is titled: **Quartus Prime Lite Edition**. If it says **“Quartus Prime Pro Edition”**, you failed to reconfigure the quartus_setup.sh
  file.

## Lab 2: New Quartus Prime Design from DevCloud Server

After Quartus is opened, we need to transfer two Quartus Archive Project Files from our local downloads folder to the DevCloud.

#### 2.0: Downloading .qar Files from University Workshop Page

- [ ] Download the two following .qar files onto your local desktop downloads folder from the Intel DevCloud University WikiPage
  * five_bit_adder.qar
  * ram_adder.qar
- [ ] Create a source destination folder in your Documents folder using the X2Go terminal named: *quickstart_project*

#### 2.1: Copying Local .qar Files from PC to DevCloud Terminal

To copy local files to your login node (your PC terminal), you cannot be on the head node. In other words, use a local terminal on your PC. You can copy local files to your login node like this:

```
scp /path/to/local/file colfax‐intel:/user#/path/to/remote/directory
```

- [ ] Copy the file from your local desktop to the DevCloud server using the following commands and destination path. Revise the source pathway accordingly.

```bash
scp /home/username/MyDocuments/rtl_quickstart_files/five_bit_adder.qar colfax‐intel:/home/u1234/Documents/quickstart_project

scp /home/username/MyDocuments/rtl_quickstart_files/ram_adder.qar colfax-intel:/home/u1234/Documents/quickstart_project
```

- [ ] Ignore the “X11 forwarding request failed on channel 0” message. Look in your destination folder in X2Go to determine if the transfers were completed.
  
  Alternatively, use Section 8.3: WinSCP instructions shown in the [DevCloud Installation Instructions](https://github.com/intel/FPGA-Devcloud/tree/master/main/Devcloud_Access_Instructions#devcloud-access-instructions).

###### Figure 3: Successful Transfer of File in Project directory in X2Go terminal

#### 2.2: Unarchiving .qar files in Quartus Prime GUI

Now we need to unarchive the .qar files that were just transferred to the DevCloud server.

- [ ] Under the **File** tab, click **Open Project** or press **Ctrl+J** to open a project.

###### Figure 4: Open Project menu

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59750149/78845809-8af0b780-79be-11ea-9446-05318ff96bce.png" alt="image-project" width=30% />

- [ ] Locate the **five_bit_adder.qar** file that you transferred into the quickstart_project destination folder. Refer to the pathway that you entered in your local command terminal.
- [ ] Select the **five_bit_adder.qar** file, and click **Open**.

###### Figure 5: Open Project five_bit_adder.qar file window

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59750149/78845931-db681500-79be-11ea-8a1c-d7d4461466ba.png" alt="image-open-project" width=70% />

The window illustrated in Figure 6 will pop up.

- [ ] Click **OK** and all the source and design files will be saved in the destination folder named
  five_bit_adder_restored.

###### Figure 6: Restore Archived Project for five_bit_adder_restored window

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59750149/78845997-22eea100-79bf-11ea-88dd-d7829b6df9ab.png" alt="image-restoreqar" width=67% />

#### 2.3: Unarchiving .qar Files in Command Line

This section describes how to unarchive .qar files using the Quartus Prime Shell.

- [ ] Change your directory to the quickstart_project folder containing five_bit_adder.qar and ram_adder.qar.
- [ ] From a terminal that is logged in to the DevCloud, type and enter the following to restore a project archive in the Quartus Prime Shell:

```
quartus_sh ‐‐restore [<options>] <.qar file name>
```

- [ ] Run the following command in the terminal to unarchive ram_adder.qar

```
quartus_sh ‐‐restore ‐output ram_adder_restored ram_adder.qar
```

The Quartus Prime Shell should state that the job was successfully completed. All source and design files will be saved in the destination folder named ram_adder_restored. For additional information on Quartus Prime Command-Line and Tcl API Help, enter the following into the terminal:

```
quartus_sh ‐‐qhelp
```

#### 2.4: Installing the USB Blaster to Download a Design to a Local FPGA

- [ ] To download your completed FPGA design from the DevCloud into a Local PC attached development kit, start by connecting the USB Blaster cable between your PC USB port and the USB Blaster port on your development kit. If you are not using the DE10-Lite, you may have to plug the kit into power using a wall adapter. Upon plugging in your device, you should see flashing LEDs and 7-segment displays counting in hexadecimal, or other lit up LEDs and 7-segments depending on previous projects that have been downloaded to the local development kit.

  *NOTE: The lights and switches controlled on the DevCloud connected server kit cannot be controlled unless system console or another form of instrumentation is used.*

- [ ] To use the USB Blaster to program your local device, you need to install the USB Blaster driver. To begin, open your Device Manager by hitting the Windows Key and typing **Device Manager**. Click the appropriate tile labeled Device Manager that appears.
- [ ] Navigate to the Other Devices section of the Device Manager and expand the section below.
- [ ] Right click the USB Blaster device and select Update Driver Software.
- [ ] Choose to browse your computer for driver software and navigate to the path shown below in Figure 8.
- [ ] Once you have the proper file path selected, click on Next and the driver for the USB Blaster should be installed.

#### 2.5: Connecting a Local PC USB Blaster through the DevCloud

- [ ] On your PC, launch the Quartus Programmer. Search “Programmer” in the File Explorer

###### Figure 7: Device Manager with uninstalled USB Blaster driver

If you don’t have the Programmer on your PC, download it from this link:
http://fpgasoftware.intel.com/18.1/?edition=lite&download_manager=dlm3&platform=windows

- [ ] Select Additional Software and download the Quartus Prime Programmer and Tools.

###### Figure 10: Downloading Quartus Prime Programmer and Tools Package
